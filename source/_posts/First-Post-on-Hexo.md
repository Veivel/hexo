Welcome, to whoever is reading this out there! This is my first time writing a post directly on Hexo. If you're seeing this, I've moved to Hexo and all previous posts on `bearblog.dev` have been migrated. Below this post are all the things I've posted before on other platforms.

Hexo is a Markdown blogging framework that works by taking your markdown files and html templates to generate static pages. It allows you to customize these templates to include CSS, JS, or whatever other styling language and scripting that you want to include. It also has a gallery of community-made templates that you can download to use on your own.

### The Hexo Experience

I was looking for a customizable, lightweight framework that would allow me to just kickstart a blog, preferrably with pages powered by JS and content sourced from MD, then give me the freedom from that point onwards to do whatever I want with the customization.

After scouring the internet through documentation and blogging frameworks, I found one that seemed to fit my needs and hadn't been abandoned by its maintainers: Hexo.
